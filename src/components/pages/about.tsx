      <p>
        I'm a student at Ontario Tech University studying Networking & IT
        Security (Hons).
        <br />
        <br />
        I have 3+ years of experience in full-stack web development, software
        engineering, and cybersecurity.
        <br />
        <br />
        I love technology, whether it's building applications, creating
        networks, or hacking stuff (legally of course)! I aspire to become a
        cybersecurity analyst one day, especially since I really enjoy working
        on the server-side.
        <br />
        <br />
        Apart from the tech stuff, I love going to the gym, swimming, and trying
        new food.
